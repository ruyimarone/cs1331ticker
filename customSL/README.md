Custom SL Version for CS1331 Ticker!!!!
=======================================

* This code was adapted by Jim Harris from Toyoda Masashi's original SL code.

* To build the executable, just navigate into the directory and run

```bash
$ make
```

* To run the program in a loop, just make trainLoop.sh executable and run that.
* This version of SL does not support exiting with CTRL+C, but there is a 1
second delay between loops. Hit CTRL+C during that period to abort.
