#Ticker
This is a general purpose script that will cause a given block of text to scroll smoothly across the terminal, if possible.

Running:
```
python ticker.py <filename>
```
Will cause the text in \<filename\> to scroll across the terminal. Tabs can cause issues, but blocks of text wider than the terminal will be handled gracefully.
